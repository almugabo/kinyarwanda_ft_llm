# Instruction fine-tuning : General instructions


This directory contains scripts used in instruction fine-tuning

This is just an experiment to test the usefulness of existing instruction-finetunig dataset

in this case we use a sample of 3000 instructions from dolly dataset :
- 1500 in english
- 1500 in kinyarwanda (translated from english to kinyarwanda using Claude Sonnet 3.5 API )
