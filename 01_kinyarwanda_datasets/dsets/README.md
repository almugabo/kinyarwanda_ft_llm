# some experimental datasets which could be used for pre-training 


### 1. government documents

the first version **"gov_texts_v20240807.zip"** contains texts from about 90 documents (still needs some cleaning)

### 2. Kinyarwanda manuals

the file **"kin_manuals_gusoma_v20240807.zip"** contains kinyarwanda which was used in school in the past (N-B: it contains partly old way of writing e.g. kabili (2) rather than kabiri)
